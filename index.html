        <p><strong>Scatter Plot:</strong> Most observations clustered at low precipitation (&lt; 0.5 in) with relatively high humidity (~70–85%), indicating many humid days without heavy rain. Larger precipitation events are rare but occur alongside high humidity (e.g. <span style="color:#ff9896">Apr</span> shows the largest rain point ≈3.2 in).</p>
        <p>Wind-speed (point size) does not show a clear positive relationship with precipitation magnitude — larger wind points appear across low-to-moderate rainfall values. Overall, humidity tends to be high when rainfall occurs, but high humidity alone does not guarantee heavy precipitation.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Bar Charts:</strong> Average cloudcover peaks in <span style="color:#ff9896">Apr</span> (~40–43%) and is lowest in <span style="color:#fdd0a2">Oct</span> (~28%), suggesting April is the cloudiest month while October is relatively clearer.</p>
        <p>Visibility is stable (~5.8–6.2 km) with slightly higher values in <span style="color:#fdd0a2">Oct</span> and <span style="color:#ffbb78">Feb</span>. Solar radiation rises from <span style="color:#aec7e8">Jan</span> toward a peak in <span style="color:#fdd0a2">Oct</span>, matching the lower cloudcover in October. Moonphase averages vary little month-to-month; <span style="color:#ffbb78">Feb</span> is marginally higher.</p>
