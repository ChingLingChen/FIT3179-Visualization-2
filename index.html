    <h1>Malaysia Weather Dashboard</h1>
    <p class="intro">
      This dashboard  
      provides a  
      comprehensive  
      overview of  
      Malaysia's  
      weather patterns  
      through a series  
      of interactive  
      charts and maps.  
      Users can explore  
      key meteorological  
      metrics such as  
      precipitation,  
      humidity, wind  
      speed, and UV  
      index across  
      different months  
      and regions.
