    <h1>Malaysia Weather Dashboard</h1>
    <p class="intro">
      This dashboard  
      provides a  
      comprehensive  
      overview of  
      Malaysia's  
      weather patterns  
      through a series  
      of interactive  
      charts and maps.  
      Users can explore  
      key meteorological  
      metrics such as  
      precipitation,  
      humidity, wind  
      speed, and UV  
      index across  
      different months  
      and regions.

        <p><strong>Scatter Plot Trends:</strong> The scatter plot reveals a strong positive correlation between precipitation and humidity in 2025, with higher precipitation levels (<span style="color: #ff9896">April</span> and <span style="color: #f7b6d2">June</span>) corresponding to increased humidity. Notably, <span style="color: #aec7e8">January</span> shows moderate precipitation with lower humidity, while <span style="color: #fdd0a2">October</span> exhibits a wider spread, suggesting variable weather conditions. Wind speed influences the scatter size, with larger circles in <span style="color: #a3bffa">March</span> indicating stronger winds.</p>
        <p><strong>Bar Charts Trends:</strong> Monthly averages for cloud cover, visibility, solar radiation, and moonphase show distinct patterns. Cloud cover peaks in <span style="color: #ff9896">April</span> and <span style="color: #f7b6d2">June</span>, reducing visibility, while solar radiation is highest in <span style="color: #aec7e8">January</span> and <span style="color: #ffbb78">February</span>. Moonphase averages remain stable, with slight increases in <span style="color: #9edae5">September</span> and <span style="color: #fdd0a2">October</span>, reflecting lunar cycle influences.</p>
