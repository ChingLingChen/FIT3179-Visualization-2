    <h1>Malaysia Weather Dashboard</h1>
    <p class="intro">
      This dashboard provides a concise view of Malaysia's weather patterns in 2025.
      Explore precipitation, humidity, wind speed, cloudcover, visibility, solar radiation and moonphase by month.

          The scatterplot shows most observations clustered at low precipitation (< 0.5 in) with relatively high humidity (~70–85%),
          indicating many humid days without heavy rain. Larger precipitation events are rare but occur alongside high humidity (e.g.
          <span style="color:#ff9896">Apr</span> shows the largest rain point ≈3.2 in). Wind-speed (point size) does not show a clear
          positive relationship with precipitation magnitude — larger wind points appear across low-to-moderate rainfall values.
          Overall, humidity tends to be high when rainfall occurs, but high humidity alone does not guarantee heavy precipitation.

          Average cloudcover peaks in <span style="color:#ff9896">Apr</span> (~40–43%) and is lowest in <span style="color:#fdd0a2">Oct</span> (~28%),
          suggesting April is the cloudiest month while October is relatively clearer. Visibility is stable (~5.8–6.2 km) with slightly higher values
          in <span style="color:#fdd0a2">Oct</span> and <span style="color:#ffbb78">Feb</span>. Solar radiation rises from January
          (<span style="color:#aec7e8">Jan</span>) toward a peak in <span style="color:#fdd0a2">Oct</span>, matching the lower cloudcover in October.
          Moonphase averages vary little month-to-month; <span style="color:#ffbb78">Feb</span> is marginally higher. These monthly patterns suggest
          October is the clearest/sunniest month and April has both higher cloud cover and notable heavy-rain events.
